# git_migrate_monorepo.sh
#
# üì¶ PURPOSE:
#   Safely transition a monorepo that uses duplicate folders (e.g. magmabi-prod)
#   into a clean Git branch-based workflow.
#
# üìå WHEN TO USE:
#   Run this script only once when you're ready to remove -prod folders and
#   create `main` and `develop` branches to manage your environments.
#
# üõ°Ô∏è WHAT IT DOES:
#   1. Confirms you're inside a Git repo.
#   2. Commits any uncommitted changes as a pre-migration snapshot.
#   3. Creates a backup branch `prod-legacy`.
#   4. Creates `main` and `develop` branches from current state.
#   5. Removes the `*-prod` folders from Git and the filesystem.
#
# üí° SAFETY NOTES:
#   - This script **does not touch remote branches**.
#   - A full backup branch is created in case you need to roll back.
#   - You must verify that removing the prod folders is appropriate.
