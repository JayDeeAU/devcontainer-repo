# üé≠ **Detailed Scenario Workflows**

## üåü **Scenario 1: Feature Development**

**Purpose:** Develop new functionality in isolation with live development environment

### **When to Use:**
- Building new features
- Adding functionality
- Implementing user stories
- Experimental development

### **Prerequisites:**
- Clean develop branch
- No uncommitted changes

### **Entry Point:**
```bash
# Ensure clean starting state
gco develop                  # git-safe-checkout develop
gp origin develop           # git-safe-push (pull latest)

# Start new feature
gffs user-dashboard          # git-enhanced-feature-start
```

**What `gffs user-dashboard` does:**
1. Validates feature name format (lowercase-with-hyphens)
2. Executes `git flow feature start user-dashboard`
3. Creates `feature/user-dashboard` branch from develop
4. Switches to **local environment** (port 7700)
5. Enables full source mounting (frontend + backend)
6. Provides development tips

**Environment State After Entry:**
- **Branch:** `feature/user-dashboard`
- **Environment:** Local development (port 7700)
- **Source Mounting:** ‚úÖ Full (instant code changes)
- **Access Points:** 
  - Frontend: http://localhost:7700
  - Backend: http://localhost:7710
  - Redis: http://localhost:7730

### **Working in Scenario:**

#### **Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Make changes - they appear instantly due to source mounting
vim frontend/components/Dashboard.tsx
vim backend/api/dashboard.py

# Changes are live immediately:
# - Frontend hot reloads at http://localhost:7700
# - Backend auto-reloads at http://localhost:7710
```

#### **Commit Workflow:**
```bash
# Commit frequently with conventional commits
feat "add dashboard layout structure"
feat "implement dashboard data fetching"
fix "resolve dashboard responsive design issues"
test "add unit tests for dashboard components"
docs "update dashboard API documentation"
style "format dashboard code with prettier"
```

#### **Backup/Collaboration:**
```bash
# Push work regularly for backup and collaboration
gp origin feature/user-dashboard    # git-safe-push
```

#### **Testing:**
```bash
# Test your feature in the local environment
curl http://localhost:7710/api/dashboard
curl http://localhost:7710/health

# Frontend testing
# Visit http://localhost:7700/dashboard

# Monitor logs
env-logs backend             # Show backend logs
env-logs frontend            # Show frontend logs
```

### **Scenario Completion:**

#### **Pre-completion Checks:**
```bash
# Ensure all work is committed
gs                           # Check status (should be clean)

# Optional: Clean up commit history
git rebase -i HEAD~5         # Squash WIP commits (no custom alias)
```

#### **Finish Feature:**
```bash
gfff                         # git-enhanced-feature-finish
```

**What `gfff` does:**
1. Validates you're on a feature branch
2. Checks for uncommitted changes
3. Runs optional tests if available
4. Executes `git flow feature finish user-dashboard`
5. Merges feature ‚Üí develop branch
6. Deletes feature branch
7. Switches to **staging environment** (port 7600)
8. Provides next steps guidance

**Environment State After Completion:**
- **Branch:** `develop`
- **Environment:** Staging (port 7600)
- **Feature:** Integrated and ready for release
- **Access Points:**
  - Frontend: http://localhost:7600 (with your feature)
  - Backend: http://localhost:7610 (with your feature)

#### **Post-completion Actions:**
```bash
# Push completed feature to GitHub
gp origin develop            # git-safe-push

# Optional: Create documentation PR
gh pr create --title "feat: user dashboard completed" \
  --body "Feature implemented and tested" \
  --base develop --head develop
```

### **Exit State:**
- **Location:** develop branch, staging environment
- **Status:** Feature integrated and ready for release
- **Next Options:** Start new feature, prepare release, or test in staging

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **Issue: Merge Conflicts During `gfff`**
```bash
# If conflicts occur during feature finish:
git status                   # See conflicted files
vim conflicted-file.py       # Resolve conflicts manually
ga conflicted-file.py        # git-safe-add
git commit                   # Complete merge (no custom alias needed)
gfff                         # Retry finish
```

#### **Issue: Tests Fail Before Finish**
```bash
# Fix tests first
npm test                     # Or pytest, etc.
fix "resolve failing tests"
gfff                         # Retry finish
```

# origin/feature/user-authentication (Developer C)
```

#### **Prepare for Integration:**
```bash
# Ensure develop is current
gp origin develop           # git-safe-push (pulls latest)
```

### **Working in Scenario:**

#### **Integration Process (Sequential):**

##### **Feature 1: User Dashboard**
```bash
# Integrate first feature
git merge origin/feature/user-dashboard --no-ff
# Note: No custom alias - need specific merge control

# Test integration in staging
curl http://localhost:7610/api/dashboard
# Visit http://localhost:7600/dashboard for UI testing

# If integration successful
gp origin develop           # git-safe-push
git branch -d feature/user-dashboard           # Clean up local
gp origin --delete feature/user-dashboard      # git-safe-push delete remote
```

##### **Feature 2: Analytics Reports**
```bash
# Integrate second feature
git merge origin/feature/analytics-reports --no-ff

# Test with first feature (integration testing)

# List of active feature branches
FEATURE_BRANCHES=(
    "feature/reporting-system"
    "feature/admin-panel" 
    "feature/data-export"
)

for branch in "${FEATURE_BRANCHES[@]}"; do
    if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/$branch; then
        echo "üìù Updating $branch..."
        git checkout $branch
        git rebase develop
        git push --force-with-lease origin $branch
        echo "‚úÖ $branch updated"
    else
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  $branch not found locally"
    fi
done

echo "üéâ All feature branches updated with hotfix"
EOF

chmod +x update-all-features.sh
```

##### **Execute Team Updates:**
```bash
# Run the update script
./update-all-features.sh

# Or manually update each branch
gco feature/reporting-system   # git-safe-checkout
git rebase develop
gp --force-with-lease origin feature/reporting-system

gco feature/admin-panel        # git-safe-checkout  
git rebase develop

env-prod                     # Production environment (port 7500)
env-health                   # Verify production health
```

##### **Terminal 2: Staging Testing**
```bash
env-staging                  # Staging environment (port 7600)
env-health                   # Verify staging health
```

##### **Terminal 3: Local Development**
```bash
gco feature/your-work        # git-safe-checkout (auto-switches to local 7700)
env-health                   # Verify local health
```

### **Working in Scenario:**

#### **Comparative Testing:**

##### **Health Checks:**
```bash
# Terminal 1 (Production)
curl http://localhost:7510/health

# Terminal 2 (Staging)  
curl http://localhost:7610/health

# Terminal 3 (Local)
curl http://localhost:7710/health
```

##### **Feature Testing:**

# Test same endpoint across environments
# Production (stable version)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7510/api/analytics/report

# Staging (next version)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7610/api/analytics/report

# Local (development version)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7710/api/analytics/report
```

##### **Performance Comparison:**
```bash
# Performance testing script
cat > test-performance.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "üöÄ Performance Testing Across Environments"
echo "=========================================="

for env in 7510 7610 7710; do
    echo ""
    echo "Testing port $env:"
    for i in {1..5}; do
        response_time=$(curl -w "%{time_total}" -s -o /dev/null "http://localhost:$env/health")
        echo "  Request $i: ${response_time}s"
    done
done
EOF

chmod +x test-performance.sh
./test-performance.sh
```

#### **Environment Status Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check all environments simultaneously
env-status                   # Overall status display

# Monitor logs across environments
# Terminal 1: env-logs backend  (production logs)
# Terminal 2: env-logs backend  (staging logs)  
# Terminal 3: env-logs backend  (local logs)
```

#### **Data Consistency Testing:**
```bash
# Test data flow and consistency
# Create test data in local
curl -X POST http://localhost:7710/api/test-data -d '{"test": true}'

# Check if it appears correctly in staging

- **Local:** Ready for continued development

---

## üîç **Scenario 7: Production Investigation (Debug Mode)**

**Purpose:** Investigate production issues with source code access

### **When to Use:**
- Production bugs need source-level investigation
- Need to trace through production code
- Performance debugging required
- Understanding production behavior

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- Debug mode is for **investigation only**
- Don't make code changes in production debug mode
- Use local hotfix branches for actual fixes
- Temporarily replaces production environment

### **Prerequisites:**
- Production issue identified
- Investigation required at source level
- Understanding that this replaces production temporarily

### **Entry Point:**

#### **Enable Production Debug Mode:**
```bash
env-prod-debug              # Production with source mounting enabled
```

**What `env-prod-debug` does:**
1. Warns about replacing production environment
2. Requests confirmation
3. Stops production containers
4. Starts production containers with source mounting
5. Uses production configuration but development builds
6. Enables live source code access

**Environment State After Entry:**
- **Branch:** `main` (production code)
- **Environment:** Production debug mode (port 7500)
- **Source Mounting:** ‚úÖ Enabled (for investigation)
- **Configuration:** Production settings
- **Build:** Development build with source access

### **Working in Scenario:**

#### **Issue Investigation:**
```bash
# Investigate production issue with source access
# View logs with source context
env-logs backend

# Trace through actual production code
vim backend/api/payments.py     # Read-only investigation
vim frontend/components/PaymentForm.tsx

# Add debugging statements for investigation (temporary)
echo "console.log('Debug: Payment processing')" >> frontend/components/PaymentForm.tsx
echo "print('Debug: API called')" >> backend/api/payments.py

# Test with debug statements
curl -X POST http://localhost:7510/api/payments/test
# Monitor real-time logs
env-logs backend
```

#### **Performance Investigation:**
```bash
# Monitor resource usage in production debug
env-status                   # Check container resources

# Test performance with source access
curl -w "%{time_total}" http://localhost:7510/api/slow-endpoint

# Investigate bottlenecks
vim backend/api/slow_endpoint.py    # Find performance issues
```

#### **Configuration Investigation:**
```bash
# Check production configuration with source access
cat backend/api/config.py    # View production settings
env-logs backend | grep "ENVIRONMENT=production"

# Verify environment variables
docker exec -it magmabi_backend-prod env | grep API_
```

### **Investigation Best Practices:**

#### **Document Findings:**
```bash
# Create investigation log
cat > investigation-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).md << 'EOF'
# Production Investigation Log

## Issue
- Description: Payment timeout in production
- Started: $(date)
- Environment: Production debug mode

## Findings
- Line 45 in payments.py has blocking call
- Frontend timeout set to 30s, backend takes 45s
- Production database has higher latency

## Root Cause
- Missing async handling in payment processor
- No timeout configuration for external API

## Recommended Fix
- Add async/await to payment processing
- Configure timeout for external calls
- Add retry logic for failed payments
EOF
```

#### **Prepare Fix Strategy:**
```bash
# Document the fix approach (don't implement here)
echo "üîß Fix Strategy:" >> investigation-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).md
echo "1. Create hotfix branch in local environment" >> investigation-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).md
echo "2. Implement async payment processing" >> investigation-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).md
echo "3. Add proper timeout handling" >> investigation-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).md
echo "4. Test in local, then staging" >> investigation-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).md
echo "5. Deploy via standard hotfix process" >> investigation-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).md
```

### **Scenario Completion:**

#### **Exit Debug Mode:**
```bash
env-prod                     # Return to normal production mode
```

**What this does:**
1. Stops production debug containers
2. Starts normal production containers (built images)
3. Removes source mounting
4. Restores production security

#### **Implement Fix (Separate Process):**
```bash
# Now create proper hotfix in local environment
ghfs 1.2.4                  # Start hotfix in local environment

# Implement the fix based on investigation
vim backend/api/payments.py  # Add async handling
vim backend/api/config.py    # Add timeout config

# Test fix in local environment (port 7700)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7710/api/payments/test

# Complete standard hotfix process
fix "implement async payment processing with timeout handling"
ghff 1.2.4                  # Deploy hotfix to production
```

### **Exit State:**
- **Production:** Restored to normal operation
- **Investigation:** Completed with documented findings
- **Fix:** Implemented via proper hotfix process

### **When to Use:**
- Container troubleshooting
- Resource management
- Environment cleanup
- Health monitoring
- Log analysis

### **Prerequisites:**
- Basic container understanding
- Access to container management commands

### **Entry Point:**

#### **Environment Assessment:**
```bash
env-status                   # Overall environment status
```

**What `env-status` shows:**
- Running environments and ports
- Container health status
- Resource usage
- Available commands

### **Working in Scenario:**

#### **Health Management:**

##### **Comprehensive Health Check:**
```bash
env-health                   # Check all environments
```

**What `env-health` does:**
1. Tests all environment endpoints
2. Checks container status
3. Verifies port accessibility
4. Reports resource usage
5. Identifies issues

##### **Individual Environment Health:**
```bash
# Check specific environment
env-prod && env-health       # Production health
env-staging && env-health    # Staging health  
env-local && env-health      # Local health
```

#### **Log Management:**

##### **View Container Logs:**
```bash
env-logs                     # All services current environment
env-logs backend             # Specific service logs
env-logs frontend            # Frontend logs
env-logs redis               # Redis logs
env-logs celery_worker       # Celery worker logs
```

##### **Monitor Live Logs:**
```bash
# Follow logs in real-time
env-logs backend --follow    # Live backend logs
env-logs frontend --follow   # Live frontend logs

# Filter logs
env-logs backend | grep ERROR        # Error messages only
env-logs backend | grep "API called" # Specific log pattern
```

#### **Environment Control:**

##### **Stop Environments:**
```bash
env-stop                     # Stop all environments (with confirmation)
env-stop prod               # Stop production only
env-stop staging            # Stop staging only  
env-stop local              # Stop local only
env-stop all                # Stop all (forced)
```

##### **Restart Environments:**
```bash
# Restart current environment
env-staging                  # Restarts staging
env-prod                    # Restarts production
env-local                   # Restarts local
```

##### **Resource Management:**
```bash
# Check Docker resources
docker system df            # Disk usage
docker stats               # Live resource usage

# Clean up unused resources
docker system prune -f     # Remove unused containers/images
docker volume prune -f     # Remove unused volumes
```

#### **Troubleshooting:**

##### **Container Issues:**
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps -a | grep magmabi

# Inspect specific container
docker inspect magmabi_backend-prod

# Execute commands in container
docker exec -it magmabi_backend-prod bash
```

##### **Network Issues:**
```bash
# Test container networking
docker network ls | grep magmabi

# Test port accessibility
curl -v http://localhost:7510/health    # Production
curl -v http://localhost:7610/health    # Staging
curl -v http://localhost:7710/health    # Local
```

##### **Volume Issues:**
```bash
# Check volume mounts
docker volume ls | grep magmabi

# Inspect volume contents
docker run --rm -v magmabi_redis_data_prod:/data alpine ls -la /data
```

#### **Environment Switching Management:**

##### **Force Environment Switch:**
```bash
# When automatic switching fails
env-stop all               # Stop everything
env-prod                   # Start fresh production
```

##### **Debug Environment Issues:**
```bash
# Check environment detection
git branch --show-current  # Current branch
docker ps                  # Running containers

# Manual container management
cd docker
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps       # Production status
docker compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml ps    # Staging status
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ps      # Local status
```

#### **Performance Monitoring:**

##### **Resource Usage:**
```bash
# Monitor container resources
docker stats --format "table {{.Name}}\t{{.CPUPerc}}\t{{.MemUsage}}"

# Check environment performance
for port in 7510 7610 7710; do
    echo "Testing port $port:"
    curl -w "Time: %{time_total}s\n" -s -o /dev/null "http://localhost:$port/health"
done
```

##### **Health Trends:**
```bash
# Create health monitoring script
cat > monitor-health.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
    echo "$(date): Health Check"
    env-health
    echo "---"
    sleep 300  # Check every 5 minutes
done
EOF

chmod +x monitor-health.sh
# Run in background: ./monitor-health.sh > health.log 2>&1 &
```

### **Scenario Completion:**
```bash
# Document environment state
env-status > environment-status-$(date +%Y%m%d).txt

# Return to development work
gco feature/your-work        # Resume development
```

### **Exit State:**
- **Containers:** Healthy and optimized
- **Resources:** Cleaned and monitored  
- **Logs:** Analyzed and documented
- **Environment:** Ready for development

## üóëÔ∏è **Scenario 9: Feature Abandonment**

**Purpose:** Remove unwanted features at different stages of development

### **When to Use:**
- Feature requirements changed
- Feature no longer needed
- Feature implementation flawed
- Strategic direction changed

### **Prerequisites:**
- Decision to abandon feature confirmed
- Understanding of feature's current state

### **Entry Point:**

#### **Assess Feature State:**
```bash
# Check where the feature exists
git branch -a | grep feature/unwanted-feature
git log --oneline --grep="unwanted-feature"
```

### **Working in Scenario:**

#### **Case 1: Feature Only Exists Locally**

**When:** Feature never pushed to remote, only local development

```bash
# Simple local cleanup
gco develop                  # git-safe-checkout away from feature
git branch -D feature/unwanted-feature    # Delete local branch
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Feature completely removed, no trace

#### **Case 2: Feature Pushed but Not Merged**

**When:** Feature exists on GitHub but not merged to develop/main

```bash
# Clean up local and remote
gco develop                  # git-safe-checkout to safe branch
git branch -D feature/unwanted-feature           # Delete local branch
gp origin --delete feature/unwanted-feature      # git-safe-push delete remote

# Close any associated PRs
gh pr list --head feature/unwanted-feature       # Check for PRs
gh pr close 123              # Close PR if exists
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Feature removed from everywhere, PRs closed

#### **Case 3: Feature Already in Staging (develop)**

**When:** Feature merged to develop and in staging environment

##### **Preparation:**
```bash
env-staging                  # Switch to staging environment
gl                          # git log --oneline (find merge commit)

# Test current staging state
curl http://localhost:7610/api/unwanted-endpoint
# Visit http://localhost:7600 to see feature in staging
```

##### **Revert the Feature:**
```bash
# Find the merge commit
git log --oneline --grep="unwanted-feature"
# Example output: abc123d Merge branch 'feature/unwanted-feature' into develop

# Revert the merge commit
git revert abc123d -m 1     # Revert to parent 1 (develop branch)
feat "remove unwanted feature - requirements changed"
```

##### **Test Removal:**
```bash
# Verify feature removed from staging
curl http://localhost:7610/api/unwanted-endpoint    # Should return 404
# Visit http://localhost:7600 to verify UI changes removed

# Push removal
gp origin develop           # git-safe-push
```

##### **Cleanup:**
```bash
# Remove feature branches if they still exist
gp origin --delete feature/unwanted-feature      # git-safe-push delete remote
git branch -D feature/unwanted-feature           # Delete local if exists
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Feature functionality removed from staging, history preserved

#### **Case 4: Feature Already in Production (main)**

**When:** Feature is live and causing production issues

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Process - Use Emergency Hotfix:**

##### **Emergency Removal Hotfix:**
```bash
ghfs 1.2.4                  # git-enhanced-hotfix-start for removal
```

##### **Remove Feature from Production:**
```bash
# Remove feature functionality (in local hotfix environment)
vim backend/api/routes.py        # Remove unwanted endpoints
vim frontend/components/App.tsx  # Remove unwanted components
vim backend/database/models.py   # Remove unwanted database changes

# Test removal locally
curl http://localhost:7710/api/unwanted-endpoint    # Should return 404
# Visit http://localhost:7700 to verify feature removed
```

##### **Document Removal:**
```bash
fix "emergency removal of problematic feature causing production issues"
docs "document feature removal and migration steps for users"
```

##### **Deploy Removal:**
```bash
ghff 1.2.4                  # git-enhanced-hotfix-finish
# Applies removal to both main (production) and develop (staging)

# Push everything
gp origin main develop --tags    # git-safe-push

# Create emergency release documentation
gh release create v1.2.4 \
  --title "Emergency Release: Remove Problematic Feature" \
  --notes "Emergency removal of feature causing production instability"
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Feature removed from production and staging, proper hotfix process followed

#### **Case 5: Feature in Release Branch**

**When:** Feature in release preparation but needs removal

```bash
# Switch to release branch
gco release/2.0.0           # git-safe-checkout

# Remove feature from release
git revert <feature-merge-commit> -m 1
feat "remove feature from v2.0.0 release - deferred to v2.1.0"

# Test release without feature
curl http://localhost:7710/api/unwanted-endpoint    # Should return 404

# Push updated release
gp origin release/2.0.0     # git-safe-push
```

### **When to Use:**
- Alternative solution found
- Issue resolved by other means
- Hotfix approach incorrect
- Emergency situation changed

### **Prerequisites:**
- Hotfix currently in development
- Decision to abandon confirmed

### **Entry Point:**

#### **Assess Hotfix State:**
```bash
# Check current hotfix status
git branch --show-current    # Should be hotfix/x.y.z
gl                          # Check commits in hotfix
```

### **Working in Scenario:**

#### **Case 1: Hotfix Not Yet Pushed**

**When:** Hotfix exists only locally

```bash
# Simple abandonment
gco main                     # git-safe-checkout to main
git branch -D hotfix/1.2.3   # Delete hotfix branch
env-prod                     # Return to production environment
```

#### **Case 2: Hotfix Pushed but Not Merged**

**When:** Hotfix branch exists on GitHub, possibly with PR

```bash
# Clean up local and remote
gco main                     # git-safe-checkout to main  
git branch -D hotfix/1.2.3               # Delete local branch
gp origin --delete hotfix/1.2.3          # git-safe-push delete remote

# Close hotfix PR if exists
gh pr list --head hotfix/1.2.3           # Check for PR
gh pr close 456 --comment "Alternative solution implemented"    # Close with reason

env-prod                     # Return to production environment
```

#### **Case 3: Alternative Solution Implemented**

## üîÑ **Scenario 11: Emergency Scenario Switching**

**Purpose:** Rapidly switch between scenarios during emergencies

### **When to Use:**
- Production emergency during feature development
- Critical hotfix needed during release preparation
- Urgent testing required during normal development
- Multiple priority issues simultaneously

### **Prerequisites:**
- Current work can be safely paused
- Emergency situation confirmed

### **Entry Point:**

#### **Emergency Assessment:**
```bash
# Quick status check
gs                           # Current git status
env-status                   # Current environment status
git branch --show-current    # What you're working on
```

### **Working in Scenario:**

#### **Pattern 1: Feature Development ‚Üí Emergency Hotfix**

**Current State:** Working on feature

##### **Emergency Save:**
```bash
# Rapid work preservation
feat "WIP: emergency checkpoint before critical hotfix"
gp origin feature/current-work    # git-safe-push backup
```

##### **Emergency Switch:**
```bash
ghfs 1.2.4                  # git-enhanced-hotfix-start (immediate switch)
# Environment automatically switches to local (port 7700)
# Can implement hotfix with full source mounting
```

##### **Emergency Fix:**
```bash
# Implement critical fix rapidly
vim backend/api/critical-endpoint.py
fix "emergency fix for critical production issue"

# Test immediately
curl http://localhost:7710/api/critical-endpoint

# Deploy immediately
ghff 1.2.4                  # git-enhanced-hotfix-finish (to production)
```

##### **Return to Feature:**
```bash
gco feature/current-work     # git-safe-checkout (auto-switches back to local)
git rebase develop           # Include emergency hotfix
# Continue feature development with fix included
```

#### **Pattern 2: Release Preparation ‚Üí Production Investigation**

**Current State:** Preparing release

##### **Preserve Release State:**
```bash
# On release/2.0.0 branch
chore "pause release preparation for production investigation"
gp origin release/2.0.0     # git-safe-push backup
```

##### **Investigate Production:**
```bash
env-prod-debug              # Switch to production debug mode
# Investigate issue with source access

# Document findings
echo "Issue found in production..." > investigation-notes.txt
```

##### **Return to Release:**
```bash
env-prod                    # Exit debug mode
gco release/2.0.0           # git-safe-checkout back to release
env-local                   # Resume release preparation environment
# Continue release preparation
```

#### **Pattern 3: Multiple Concurrent Emergencies**

**Current State:** Multiple urgent issues

##### **Terminal Management:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Handle hotfix
ghfs 1.2.5                  # Emergency hotfix

# Terminal 2: Monitor production  
env-prod-debug              # Production investigation

# Terminal 3: Test in staging
env-staging                 # Staging validation

# Terminal 4: Continue feature work
gco feature/important-work   # Local development
```

##### **Priority Management:**
```bash
# Focus on highest priority first
# Terminal 1: Complete critical hotfix
fix "resolve database connection leak"
ghff 1.2.5

# Terminal 2: Exit debug when hotfix deployed
env-prod                    # Return to normal production

# Terminal 3: Test hotfix in staging
gp origin develop           # git-safe-push updated develop

# Terminal 4: Update feature with hotfix
git rebase develop          # Include hotfix in feature
```

#### **Pattern 4: Environment Failure Recovery**

**Current State:** Environment failure during work

##### **Emergency Diagnosis:**
```bash
env-health                  # Check all environments
env-status                  # Identify failed environment
```

##### **Rapid Recovery:**
```bash
# Stop failed environment
env-stop local              # Stop problematic environment

# Switch to working environment
env-staging                 # Move to staging temporarily

# Restart failed environment
env-local                   # Restart local environment

# Verify recovery
env-health                  # Confirm all environments healthy
```

##### **Continue Work:**
```bash
gco feature/your-work       # Return to work (auto-switches to local)
# Resume development in recovered environment
```

#### **Pattern 5: Cross-Environment Emergency Testing**

**Current State:** Need to test fix across all environments rapidly

##### **Rapid Multi-Environment Setup:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Deploy fix to production
ghff 1.2.6                  # Emergency hotfix deployment

# Terminal 2: Test in staging
env-staging
curl http://localhost:7610/api/fixed-endpoint

# Terminal 3: Verify in local
env-local
curl http://localhost:7710/api/fixed-endpoint

# Terminal 4: Monitor production
env-prod
env-logs backend --follow
```

##### **Coordinated Verification:**
```bash
# Script for rapid testing across environments
cat > emergency-test.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "üö® Emergency Testing Across All Environments"
echo "============================================"

for port in 7510 7610 7710; do
    echo ""
    echo "Testing port $port:"
    response=$(curl -s "http://localhost:$port/api/fixed-endpoint")
    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
        echo "‚úÖ Port $port: SUCCESS"
    else
        echo "‚ùå Port $port: FAILED"
    fi
done
EOF

chmod +x emergency-test.sh
./emergency-test.sh
```

##### **Migration Guide Creation:**
```bash
mkdir -p docs
cat > docs/MIGRATION-v2.2.0.md << 'EOF'
# Migration Guide: v2.1.x ‚Üí v2.2.0

## Overview
This guide helps you migrate from v2.1.x to v2.2.0, including breaking changes and new features.

## Breaking Changes

### 1. API Endpoint Updates
**Old:** `/api/v1/analytics`
**New:** `/api/v2/analytics`

**Migration:**
```javascript
// Before
fetch('/api/v1/analytics')

// After  
fetch('/api/v2/analytics')
```

### 2. Configuration Format Changes
**Old configuration (config.yml):**
```yaml
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  name: myapp
```

**New configuration (config.yml):**
```yaml
database:
  connection:
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    database: myapp
  pool:
    min: 5
    max: 20
```

### 3. Deprecated Feature Removal
- Legacy dashboard (`/legacy-dashboard`) removed
- Old authentication endpoints (`/auth/legacy/*`) removed

## New Features Setup

### 1. Enable Advanced Analytics
Add to your configuration:
```yaml
analytics:
  enabled: true
  real_time: true
  retention_days: 90
```

### 2. Configure OAuth2 Providers
```yaml
auth:
  oauth2:
    google:
      client_id: your_google_client_id
      client_secret: your_google_client_secret
    github:
      client_id: your_github_client_id
      client_secret: your_github_client_secret
```

## Database Migrations
Run the following migrations in order:

```bash
# Backup your database first!
pg_dump myapp > backup-before-v2.2.0.sql

# Run migrations
./manage.py migrate analytics
./manage.py migrate auth_oauth2
./manage.py migrate performance_improvements
```

## Environment Variables
New required environment variables:
```bash
ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
OAUTH2_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
OAUTH2_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=100
```

## Testing Your Migration
1. **Backup everything** before starting
2. **Test in staging first** with production data copy
3. **Verify all integrations** work with new endpoints
4. **Check performance** meets expectations
5. **Validate new features** are working correctly

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, you can rollback:

```bash
# Restore database
psql myapp < backup-before-v2.2.0.sql

# Deploy previous version
git checkout v2.1.x
./deploy.sh
```
